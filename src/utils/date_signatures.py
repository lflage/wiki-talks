"""
Module containing language-specific date parsing patterns and ISO 639 language codes.
date_sign_dict is easily acessible for public contributions

This file contains:
    - `date_sign_dict`: A dictionary containing regular expression patterns for parsing 
      date signatures in Wikipedia talk pages for different languages. The keys are 
      ISO 639-1 language codes, and values are regex patterns to identify date formats.
    - `iso_639_dict`: A dictionary mapping ISO 639-1 language codes to language names, 
      dynamically populated from a file located at `ISO_CODE_PATH`.

Example:
    Use `date_sign_dict` to retrieve the date format regex for a specific language:
    
        en_pattern = date_sign_dict['en']
